# QuotesApp-react-routing
Practice for react routing. I used Link NavLink, useParams, nested routes, Redirect and dinamic routes in this project. 
This app fetch quotes and their comments from firebase real-time database with http requests. You can add quote or write comment for a quote. User can sort quotes as ascending or descending. I used redux for state management.
